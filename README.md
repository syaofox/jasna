## Jasna

JAV model restoration tool inspired by [Lada](https://codeberg.org/ladaapp/lada).
Differences:
- GPU only processing (benchmarks TBD). Intial test for 10min: lada: 4min 12s and jasna: 3min 5s
- Improved mosaic detection model.
- Accurate color conversions on gpu (input matches output and no banding).
- Only modern Nvidia gpu is supported.
- TensorRT support.

Consider this release as very alpha.

TODO:
- improve blending
- improve performance (this version is very simple
- proper VR support
- TVAI and SeedVR
